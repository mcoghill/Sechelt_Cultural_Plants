Welcome to the setup script of for the Sechelt Cultural Plants project! Before proceeding, please ensure that you have the following programs installed on your machine:

1. R 4.0.0 or greater (32-bit required, 64-bit recommended, can have both installed at the same time. Available from [CRAN]("https://cran.r-project.org/"))
2. RStudio IDE for R (available from the [RStudio website]("https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"))

The intention of this script is to properly set up the computing environment and R packages required for carrying out this project. Checks and messages will appear at certain points if certain requirements are not met. Simply follow the instructions laid out to fix any issues you may be encountering.
